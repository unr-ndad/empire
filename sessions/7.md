### Discussion summary
During this session, we reviewed several open-source projects, paying particular attention to the research activities and experience of our grant participants.In discussing the available tools, we attended to four main project needs: 1) browsing and sharing the document collection; 2) annotating the corpus; 3) processing the corpus using machine learning, geoparsing, and text mining techniques; and 4) visualizing and exploring the corpus.

### Decisions
We resolved to adapt tools for the following purposes in building our project:
1. Browsing Corpus
**OpenONI, The Online Newspaper Initiative**
which provides a function set for loading, modeling and indexing data
2. Annotating Corpus
**BRAT**
A server-based tool used to annotate the training and verification data for natural language processing
**Pelagios and Recogito**
A semantic annotation tool for texts and images that can identify and map places
**PERDIDO Geoparser**
A flexible geoparser that could be adapted to use a manually annotated gazetteer of historic place names
4. Natural Language Processing
**Spacy**
A flexible python library for natural language processing capable of performing most of the needed project tasks
5. Visualization
**D3, Data-Driven Documents**
A Javascript library that will enable us to make custom visualizations that are web-based and interoperable across browsers
